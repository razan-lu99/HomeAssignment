This is a solution for Web App Testing and Mobile App Testing.

<h2>Web App Testing</h2>

<h4>For the Web App Testing, these are the included files:</h4>
1. BaseTest.java
2. WebElementHelpers.java
3. BookPage.java
4. BookTest.java

<h4>Proposed steps to follow for the set-up:</h4>
1. An IDE, I'm using IntelliJ.
2. Programming language, I'm using Java, JDK downloaded, preferibly version 11
3. Browser, I'm using Chrome
4. A Chrome Driver downloaded on the PC (one that is compatible with the Chrome version), I'm using version 120.0.6099.71
5. Inside Environment Variables in PC correct System Variables fixed up for the PC, "java_home"

<h4>How to execute tests:</h4>
1. When creating a project, create it as Maven.
2. After creating a Maven project go to https://mvnrepository.com/ and search for needed libraries, ex. Selenium Java, TestNG. Paste in pom.xml file
3. Run BookTest.java class

<h4>P.S.</h4> A way to execute on different test cases/scenarios easily is Cucumber. Which I'm currently taking a course on.


<h2>Mobile App Testing</h2>

<h4>For the Mobile App Testing, these are the included files:</h4>
1. MobileBaseTest.java
2. MobileElementHelpers
3. res.properties
4. Weather Forecast_3.5_Apkpure.apk
5. WeatherPage.java
6. WeatherTest.java
